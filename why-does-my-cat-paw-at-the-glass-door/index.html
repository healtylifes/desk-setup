<p>In your case it sound to me like your cat is seeing their own reflection in the mirrors etc and thinks it is another cat and is trying to get to them. But if the owner suddenly stops responding to the cats pawing the door the cat will soon discontinue the behavior. Alternatively shake a can of coins so the loud noise startles your cat. She just stops what shes doing and scratches and scratches with both paws almost as if she has a compulsion to do so. Why Does My Cat Paw At Smooth Surfaces Is It Normal Feline Follower.</p>
